This repository is meant to host the core files needed to create a Beacon Object File for use with AM0N-Eye. A Beacon Object File (BOF) is a compiled C program, written to a convention that allows it to execute within a Beacon process and use internal Beacon APIs. BOFs are a way to rapidly extend the Beacon agent with new post-exploitation features.
